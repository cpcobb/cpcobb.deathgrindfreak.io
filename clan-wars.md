War is optional, but highly encouraged. Leaders BLUNT, Jason, Queen Hart, and Nubblet will fill war cc's. Wars 2-3 times a week.

War Schedule: Tuesdays/Fridays are prep days. Wars on Wednesdays and Saturdays. War search starts at 12 noon central time. 
3rd War: Must volunteer to participate. Begins after our second war ends on Sundays.

**New** members must opt out of the first war after joining the rebellion to witness how war is conducted. This prevents confusion and establishes credibility. 

To participate in war you **MUST** be a Non Rushed TH6+ and agree to the following:

1. Attack Twice in War - Each attack should be an honest attempt to get a 3 star victory. 
2. You must opt out if your Heroes and/or Spell Factory is upgrading.  
3. NO attacking for loot or Town Hall sniping.
4. Agree to use [Clashcaller.com](http://clashcaller.com):
    * A new clashcaller.com/war/unique ID will be sent out each prep day.  Go to the site to claim the opponent you wish to face in war. 
      Claimed targets will be respected for the first 12 hours of war.  Stealing a claimed target/attack will result in you being booted.
    * You must use one attack before claiming another. It is possible to attack twice within the first 12 hours. 
    * The 2nd half of war is considered clean up. No claimed targets will be honored. Every base is available to be attacked. 
      You are expected to attack for the easiest/max amount of new stars to ensure victory during clean up.
