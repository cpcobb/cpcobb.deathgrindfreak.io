![Spirit Call](/spirit.jpg)

**Clan Tag:** #UU98QC9 <br/>
**Clan Shield:** Green/Black

No rushed bases. If you can't use clash caller please don't join. <br/> 
To avoid scouts we do not accept Jedi requests on prep/war days. <br/> 
Trophy level is 1400 to join, but there is no trophy level requirement. 

Joining the Ganja Jedi requires a minimum of: <br/>
*TH8:*  Level 2+ Dragons, Golem, and Lvl 5+ Barb King <br/>
*TH9:*  Level 2+ Golems and Combined Hero Lvl 15+ <br/>
*TH10:* Level 4+ Golems and Combined Hero Lvl 25+ <br/>
*TH11:* Max Golems and Combined Hero Lvl 35+ <br/>

**What we’re looking for:** <br/>
*Loyalty.*  Players who plan to be a part of the Jedi familia for a very long time. <br/>
*Maturity.* We don’t have an age requirement, because we don’t believe your age defines your maturity, but we expect a high level of maturity as everyone will be treated as adults.  <br/>
Highly active and friendly.  <br/>
Able and willing to participate in the majority of our clan's wars. <br/>
Currently know or willing to learn 3 star techniques. Such as GoVaHo, GoHo, GoLaLoon, Penta, Queen Walk, etc. 

We’re an ideal clan for chill people that are serious about winning wars, but who don’t want to war 24/7.
