![Sweet, sweet piano music](piano.jpg)

We are a level 7 (almost 8) war/farming family clan with a friendly, laid back attitude. Everyone is mature and respectful. We are mostly U.S. based but have Jedi from all over. 

Our focus is to help one another upgrade our bases, keep each others cc's full, work together to improve our war skills, and have fun as we strive for 3 stars in clan wars. 
 
Please check our Join the Rebellion! section for further details on how to join us.
